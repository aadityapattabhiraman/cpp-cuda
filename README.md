My initial plan was to learn cpp from the course "modern c++ for computer vision and image processing". From [this dude](https://www.youtube.com/@moderncpp2315) to be precise. But turns out he is not good at teaching stuff he is much more towards completing the course than anything else. So i had to look for alternatives and found the original author book which turns out to be a [1400 page monstor](https://www.amazon.com/C-Programming-Language-4th/dp/0321563840). I am already reading [this monster](https://szeliski.org/Book/) and i dont think i would be done anytime soon. So i am thinking of alternatives as i dont want to do the without knowing cpp itself.
